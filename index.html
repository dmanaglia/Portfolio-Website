            <article>
                <p>I am a recent graduate from the University of San Francisco looking to begin a web developement career! I earned my bachelors degree in Theology and Religious studies, a field in which I have honed my logical thinking which has been quite adventageous in my studied of computer science thus far.</p>
                <p>I have taken many courses in both highschool and college on Java, Python and R, as well as my most recent endeavor: a graduate program through Northwestern University specificly focusing on webdevelopement. Currently I am learned in all prior languages as well as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>
                <p>I have found programming to be not only rewarding but an extremly enjoyable process of peicing together a logical response to a given request or problem. I am eager to expand my knowledge and learn React and React Native to ensure I am up to date with the most common practices of the web developement field. I hope to one day soon grow this passion into a full fledged career to continue my learning through hands on experience.</p>
